# Welcome to Kotary docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.


## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md) file. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs or if a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue. 

#### Solve an issue

### Make Changes

If you'd like to add a feature or make a fix, please submit a PR explaining how your MR meets the need.

### Publish Release
